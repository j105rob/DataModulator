DataModulator
=============

This repository is for a project for a program that will modulate data from a 
file to sound then from sound back to data

In order for this program to run, make sure to have installed the following:

numpy
pyaudio

Also, it requires use of the math and os python libraries which are default
libraries with python. If you do not have these installed for some reason,
make sure to install them first.
